### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Word learning as Bayesian inference](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-295X.114.2.245) - ***Psychological Review***, 2007. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5476233692839102256)]. \[[Preprint](https://tallinzen.net/media/readings/xu_tenenbaum_2007.pdf)]. The authors present a Bayesian framework for understanding how adults and children learn the meanings of words. The theory explains how learners can generalize meaningfully from just one or a few positive examples of a novel word's referents, by making rational inductive inferences that integrate prior knowledge about plausible word meanings with the statistical structure of the observed examples. The theory addresses shortcomings of the two best known approaches to modeling word learning, based on deductive hypothesis elimination and associative learning. Three experiments with adults and children test the Bayesian account's predictions in the context of learning words for object categories at multiple levels of a taxonomic hierarchy. Results provide strong support for the Bayesian account over competing accounts, in terms of both quantitative model fits and the ability to explain important qualitative phenomena. Several extensions of the basic theory are discussed, illustrating the broader potential for Bayesian models of word learning.
*   [How to Grow a Mind: Statistics, Structure, and Abstraction](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1192788) - ***Science***, 2011. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2667398573353002097)]. \[[Preprint](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/papers/growamind.pdf)]. This review describes recent approaches to reverse-engineering human learning and cognitive development and, in parallel, engineering more humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself acquired?
*   [Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aab3050) - ***Science***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11844685101409624506)]. \[[Preprint](https://ai6034.mit.edu/wiki/images/LakeDec2015.pdf)]. \[[Supplementary Material](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/LakeEtAl2015Science_supp.pdf)]. People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms‚Äîfor action, imagination, and explanation. This work presents a computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world‚Äôs alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches.
*   [Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/building-machines-that-learn-and-think-like-people/A9535B1D745A0377E16C590E14B94993) - ***Behavioral and Brain Sciences***, 2017. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8504723689348856287)]. \[[Preprint](https://leylaroksancaglar.github.io/Caglar_Hanson_2017.pdf)]. Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. The authors review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, the authors argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. The authors suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.

### Bayesian Modeling / Generative Model

*   [Filters, random fields and maximum entropy (FRAME): Towards a unified theory for texture modeling](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007925832420) - ***International Journal of Computer Vision***, 1998. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11604954524863138240)]. \[[Preprint](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3637117/Mumford_FRAME.pdf?sequence=1)]. This article presents a statistical theory for texture modeling. This theory combines filtering theory and Markov random field modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. The theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f(I) on a random field, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f(I), given a set of observed texture examples.
*   [Object Perception as Bayesian Inference](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.142005) - ***Annual Review of Psychology***, 2004. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1611451804975333652)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/pubs/ucla/A189_dkersten_ARP2004.pdf)]. We perceive the shapes and material properties of objects quickly and reliably despite the complexity and objective ambiguities of natural images. Typical images are highly complex because they consist of many objects embedded in background clutter. Moreover, the image features of an object are extremely variable and ambiguous owing to the effects of projection, occlusion, background clutter, and illumination. The very success of everyday vision implies neural mechanisms, yet to be understood, that discount irrelevant information and organize ambiguous or noisy local image features into objects and surfaces. Recent work in Bayesian theories of visual perception has shown how complexity may be managed and ambiguity resolved through the task-dependent, probabilistic integration of prior object knowledge with image features.
*   [A tale of three probabilistic families: Discriminative, descriptive, and generative models](https://www.ams.org/journals/qam/2019-77-02/S0033-569X-2018-01528-5/home.html) - ***Quarterly of Applied Mathematics***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6129609629126793774)]. \[[Preprint](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/QAM2018.pdf)]. The pattern theory of Grenander is a mathematical framework where patterns are represented by probability models on random variables of algebraic structures. In this paper, the authors review three families of probability models, namely, the discriminative models, the descriptive models, and the generative models. A discriminative model is in the form of a classifier. It specifies the conditional probability of the class label given the input signal. A descriptive model specifies the probability distribution of the signal, based on an energy function defined on the signal. A generative model assumes that the signal is generated by some latent variables via a transformation. The authors shall review these models within a common framework and explore their connections, and shall also review the recent developments that take advantage of the high approximation capacities of deep neural networks.
*   [From information scaling of natural images to regimes of statistical models](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43638808?seq=1) - ***Quarterly of Applied Mathematics***, 2008. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17387130978932998303)]. \[[Preprint](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/papers/Quarterly_final.pdf)].  One fundamental property of natural image data that distinguishes vision from other sensory tasks such as speech recognition is that scale plays a profound role in image formation and interpretation. Specifically, visual objects can appear at a wide range of scales in the images due to the change of viewing distance as well as camera resolution. The same objects appearing at different scales produce different image data with different statistical properties. In particular, this work shows that the entropy rate of the image data changes over scale. Moreover, the inferential uncertainty changes over scale too. The authors call these changes information scaling. They then examine both empirically and theoretically two prominent and yet largely isolated classes of image models, namely, wavelet sparse coding models and Markov random field models. The results indicate that the two classes of models are appropriate for two different entropy regimes: sparse coding targets low entropy regimes, whereas Markov random fields are appropriate for high entropy regimes. Because information scaling connects different entropy regimes, both sparse coding and Markov random fields are necessary for representing natural image data, and information scaling triggers transitions between these two regimes.
*   [Minimax entropy principle and its application to texture modeling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6796444) - ***Neural Computing***, 1997. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=407872717119429940)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/vision/papers/1997e--MinimaxEntropy-NC.pdf)]. This article proposes a general theory and methodology, called the minimax entropy principle, for building statistical models for images (or signals) in a variety of applications. This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images.
*   [Parameter Expansion for Data Augmentation](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1999.10473879) - ***Journal of the American Statistical Association***, 1999. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15342818142955984734)]. \[[Preprint](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/research/papers/PXDA.pdf)]. Viewing the observed data of a statistical model as incomplete and augmenting its missing parts are useful for clarifying concepts and central to the invention of two well-known statistical algorithms: expectation-maximization (EM) and data augmentation. Recently, the authors demonstrated that expanding the parameter space along with augmenting the missing data is useful for accelerating iterative computation in an EM algorithm. The main purpose of this article is to rigorously define a parameter expanded data augmentation (PX-DA) algorithm and to study its theoretical properties. The PX-DA is a special way of using auxiliary variables to accelerate Gibbs sampling algorithms and is closely related to reparameterization techniques.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [Constraint Representation Towards Precise Data-Driven Storytelling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10766486) - ***VIS-Gen4DS'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12234019078719898658)]. A position paper on DSL for data-driven storytelling. Data-driven storytelling serves as a crucial bridge for communicating ideas in a persuasive way. However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. This viewpoint proposes integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence. The authors identify the taxonomy and required functionalities of these constraints. Although constraints can be heterogeneous and latent, this position paper explores the potential to represent them in a computation-friendly fashion via Domain-Specific Languages. The authors believe that leveraging constraints will facilitate both artistic and scientific aspects of data story generation.
