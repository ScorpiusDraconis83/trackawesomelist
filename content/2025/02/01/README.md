## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Bayesian Modeling / Generative Model

*   [Image segmentation by data-driven markov chain monte carlo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1000239) - ***IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence***, 2002. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3461400072144667491)]. \[[Preprint](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/papers/DDMCMC_reprint.pdf)]. This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian statistical framework. The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way.
