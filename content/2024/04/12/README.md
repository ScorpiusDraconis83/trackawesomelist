## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Domain Specified Applications

*   [Universal chemical programming language for robotic synthesis repeatability](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-023-00473-6) - ***Nature Synthesis***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3455106495990439366)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/images/pubs/rauschen-natsynthesisjan24.pdf)]. This paper presents an approach that uses a universal chemical programming language (œáDL) to encode and execute synthesis procedures for a variety of chemical reactions, including reductive amination, ring formation, esterification, carbon‚Äìcarbon bond formation and amide coupling on four different hardware systems in two laboratories. With around 50 lines of code per reaction, the approach uses abstraction to efficiently compress chemical protocols.

## [2. Awesome Transit](/content/CUTR-at-USF/awesome-transit/README.md)

### GTFS Realtime Utilities / Ruby

*   [GTFS Realtime Prediction Accuracy metrics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-AOtPaEViMcY6B5uTAYj7oVkwry3LfAQJg3ihSRTVoU/edit#heading=h.j27shba7rlk6) - Useful Performance Metrics for GTFS-Realtime.

## [3. Free for Dev](/content/ripienaar/free-for-dev/README.md)

### Code Generation

*   [Cody AI](https://sourcegraph.com/cody) - Cody is a coding AI assistant that uses AI and a deep understanding of your codebase to help you write and understand code faster. Cody gives developers a choice of LLMs (including local inference), has support for various IDEs, supports all popular programming languages, and has a free plan. The free plan gives developers 20 chat messages (using Claude 3 Sonnet as the LLM) and 500 autocompletions (using the Starcoder 16b) each month.

### Low-code Platform
