An evidence-based study concluding that people call category members to mind according to their location in representational space, specifically based on the predicted usefulness of considering category members with particular features.

### Concepts / AI Concept Representation

*   [Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588) - 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5847238732288003106\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. A preliminary work empirically showing that the intermediate embeddings of multilingual Transformers (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. Also, the embedding of abstract concept space lies closer to English than to other languages.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [Communicating Natural Programs to Humans and Machines](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/182aed0379591ebd1d655b2bdc152075-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html) - ***NeurIPS'22***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13381039702346039142\&as_sdt=0,5)]. While humans readily generate and interpret instructions in a general language, computer systems are shackled to a narrow domain-specific language that they can precisely execute. This makes building intelligent systems that can generalize to novel situations such as ARC difficult. Human-generated instructions are referred as \`natural programs'. While they resemble computer programs, they are distinct in two ways: First, they contain a wide range of primitives; Second, they frequently leverage communicative strategies beyond directly executable codes.

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [pix2code: Generating Code from a Graphical User Interface Screenshot](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3220134.3220135) - ***ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8296741513177971931\&as_sdt=0,5)]. \[[Code (‚≠ê12k)](https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code)]. \[[Website](https://uizard.io/research/)]. This paper shows that deep learning methods can be leveraged to train a model end-to-end to automatically reverse engineer user interfaces and generate code from a single input image with over 77% of accuracy for three different platforms (i.e. iOS, Android and web-based technologies).
