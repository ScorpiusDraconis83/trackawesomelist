*   [Artificial Analysis LLM Performance Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ArtificialAnalysis/LLM-Performance-Leaderboard): Performance benchmarks & pricing across API providers of LLMs

### **Evaluation metrics** / **OSS Alternatives for OpenAI Code Interpreter (aka. Advanced Data Analytics)**

*   Automated evaluation of LLMs
*   n-gram based metrics: Evaluates the model using n-gram statistics and F1 score. ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR are used for summarization and translation tasks.
*   Probabilistic model evaluation metrics: Evaluates the model using the predictive performance of probability models. Perplexity.
*   Embedding based metrics: Evaluates the model using semantic similarity of embeddings. Ada Similarity and BERTScore are used.

    <details>
    <summary>Expand</summary>

    *   ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): The metrics compare an automatically produced summary or translation against a reference or a set of references (human-produced) summary or translation. It includes several measures such as:

        1.  ROUGE-N: Overlap of n-grams between the system and reference summaries.
        2.  ROUGE-L: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) based statistics.
        3.  ROUGE-W: Weighted LCS-based statistics that favor consecutive LCSes.
        4.  ROUGE-S: Skip-bigram based co-occurrence statistics.
        5.  ROUGE-SU: Skip-bigram plus unigram-based co-occurrence statistics1.

    *   n-gram: An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. For example, in the sentence ‚ÄúI love AI‚Äù, the unigrams (1-gram) are ‚ÄúI‚Äù, ‚Äúlove‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI‚Äù; the bigrams (2-gram) are ‚ÄúI love‚Äù, ‚Äúlove AI‚Äù; and the trigram (3-gram) is ‚ÄúI love AI‚Äù.

    *   BLEU: BLEU‚Äôs output is always a number between 0 and 1. An algorithm for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text. The closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is.

    *   BERTScore: A metric that leverages pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT for text generation tasks. It combines precision and recall values.

    *   Perplexity: A measure of a model's predictive performance, with lower values indicating better prediction.

    *   METEOR: An n-gram based metric for machine translation, considering precision, recall, and semantic similarity.

    </details>
*   Human evaluation of LLMs (possibly Automate by LLM-based metrics): Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance on NLU and NLG tasks. It includes evaluations of relevance, fluency, coherence, and groundedness.
*   Built-in evaluation methods in Prompt flow: [ref](https://qiita.com/nohanaga/items/b68bf5a65142c5af7969) \[Aug 2023] / [ref](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/how-to-bulk-test-evaluate-flow)

### **LLMOps: Large Language Model Operations** / **OSS Alternatives for OpenAI Code Interpreter (aka. Advanced Data Analytics)**

*   [Prompt flow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/index.html): A set of LLMOps tools designed to facilitate the creation of LLM-based AI applications \[Sep 2023]
