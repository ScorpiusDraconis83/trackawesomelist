### Theory of Mind / AI Assisted Research

*   [Planning with theory of mind](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(22\)00185-1) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8461125353366208047)]. \[[Preprint](https://saxelab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/HoSaxeCushman2022.pdf)]. A perspective on understanding Theory of Mind through planning that consists of abstract structured causal representations and supports efficient search and selection from innumerable possible actions. Planning requires that Theory of Mind consists of abstract structured causal representations and supports efficient search and selection from innumerable possible actions. Theory of Mind contrasts with less cognitively demanding alternatives: statistical predictive models of other people‚Äôs actions, or model-free reinforcement of actions by their effects on other people. Theory of Mind is likely used to plan novel interventions and predict their effects, for example, in pedagogy, emotion regulation, and impression management.
