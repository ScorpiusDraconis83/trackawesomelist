### Inductive Logic & Program Synthesis / Commonsense Knowledgebase

*   [Combining Functional and Automata Synthesis to Discover Causal Reactive Programs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3571249) - ***POPL'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10470162446663474225\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. A new algorithm that synthesizes functional reactive programs from observation data, which iterates between a functional synthesis step, which attempts to generate a transition function over observed states, and an automata synthesis step, which adds any additional latent state necessary to fully account for the observations.
*   [Latent Programmer: Discrete Latent Codes for Program Synthesis](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/hong21a.html) - ***ICML'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9789877360194738968\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. Paper introducing the Latent Programmer, a program synthesis method that first predicts a discrete latent code from input/output examples, and then generates the program in the target language.
*   [PAL: Program-aided Language Models](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/gao23f) - ***ICML'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14898051625978777315\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. Paper presenting an approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps, but offloads the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. With PAL, decomposing the natural language problem into runnable steps remains the only learning task for the LLM, while solving is delegated to the interpreter.
