## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [A human-machine interface for automatic exploration of chemical reaction networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47997-9) - ***Nature Communications***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13306522324804014261)]. Autonomous reaction network exploration algorithms offer a systematic approach to explore mechanisms of complex chemical processes. However, the resulting reaction networks are so vast that an exploration of all potentially accessible intermediates is computationally too demanding. This paper introduces a STEERING WHEEL to guide an otherwise unbiased automated exploration. The STEERING WHEEL algorithm is intuitive, generally applicable, and enables one to focus on specific regions of an emerging network. It also allows for guiding automated data generation in the context of mechanism exploration, catalyst design, and other chemical optimization challenges.
