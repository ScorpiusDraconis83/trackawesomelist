### **Vector Database Comparison** / **Lucene based search engine with OpenAI Embedding**

*   [Is Cosine-Similarity of Embeddings Really About Similarity?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05440): In linear matrix factorization, the use of regularization can impact, and in some cases, render cosine similarities meaningless. Regularization involves two objectives. The first objective applies L2-norm regularization to the product of matrices A and B, a process similar to dropout. The second objective applies L2-norm regularization to each individual matrix, similar to the weight decay technique used in deep learning. \[8 Mar 2024]

    <details>
    <summary>Expand: Continued pretraining</summary>

    Three training methods were compared:

    <img src="https://github.com/kimtth/awesome-azure-openai-llm/raw/main/files\cont-pretraining.jpg" width="400"/>

    1.  Regular pretraining: A model is initialized with random weights and pretrained on dataset D1.
    2.  Continued pretraining: The pretrained model from 1) is further pretrained on dataset D2.
    3.  Retraining on combined dataset: A model is initialized with random weights and trained on the combined datasets D1 and D2.

    Continued pretraining can be as effective as retraining on combined datasets. Key strategies for successful continued pretraining include:

    1.  Re-warming: Increasing the learning rate at the start of continued pre-training.
    2.  Re-decaying: Gradually reducing the learning rate afterwards.
    3.  Data Mixing: Adding a small portion (e.g., 5%) of the original pretraining data (D1) to the new dataset (D2) to prevent catastrophic forgetting.

### **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) & SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)** / **Llama Finetuning**

*   [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08593)) is a process of pretraining and retraining a language model using human feedback to develop a scoring algorithm that can be reapplied at scale for future training and refinement. As the algorithm is refined to match the human-provided grading, direct human feedback is no longer needed, and the language model continues learning and improving using algorithmic grading alone. \[18 Sep 2019] [ref](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) \[9 Dec 2022]
    *   `Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)` is a reinforcement learning method using first-order optimization. It modifies the objective function to penalize large policy changes, specifically those that move the probability ratio away from 1. Aiming for TRPO (Trust Region Policy Optimization)-level performance without its complexity which requires second-order optimization.
