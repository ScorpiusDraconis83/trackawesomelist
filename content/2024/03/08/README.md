    5.  LoRA Family [ref](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-overview-of-the-lora-family-515d81134725) \[11 Mar 2024]
        *   `LoRA` introduces low-rank matrices A and B that are trained, while the pre-trained weight matrix W is frozen.
        *   `LoRA+` suggests having a much higher learning rate for B than for A.
        *   `VeRA` does not train A and B, but initializes them randomly and trains new vectors d and b on top.
        *   `LoRA-FA` only trains matrix B.
        *   `LoRA-drop` uses the output of B\*A to determine, which layers are worth to be trained at all.
        *   `AdaLoRA` adapts the ranks of A and B in different layers dynamically, allowing for a higher rank in these layers, where more contribution to the model‚Äôs performance is expected.
        *   `DoRA` splits the LoRA adapter into two components of magnitude and direction and allows to train them more independently.
        *   `Delta-LoRA` changes the weights of W by the gradient of A\*B.
