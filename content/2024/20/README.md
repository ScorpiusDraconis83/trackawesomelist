### **Memory Optimization** / **Llama Finetuning**

*   Transformer cache key-value tensors of context tokens into GPU memory to facilitate fast generation of the next token. However, these caches occupy significant GPU memory. The unpredictable nature of cache size, due to the variability in the length of each request, exacerbates the issue, resulting in significant memory fragmentation in the absence of a suitable memory management mechanism.
*   To alleviate this issue, PagedAttention was proposed to store the KV cache in non-contiguous memory spaces. It partitions the KV cache of each sequence into multiple blocks, with each block containing the keys and values for a fixed number of tokens.

    1.  Microsoft's Structured Prompting allows thousands of examples, by first concatenating examples into groups, then inputting each group into the LM. The hidden key and value vectors of the LM's attention modules are cached. Finally, when the user's unaltered input prompt is passed to the LM, the cached attention vectors are injected into the hidden layers of the LM.
    2.  This approach wouldn't work with OpenAI's closed models. because this needs to access \[keys] and \[values] in the transformer internals, which they do not expose. You could implement yourself on OSS ones. [cite](https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/02/microsoft-lmops-tools/) \[07 Feb 2023]

Ring Attention, which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. 2. Ring Attention can reduce the memory requirements of Transformers, enabling us to train more than 500 times longer sequence than prior memory efficient state-of-the-arts and enables the training of sequences that exceed 100 million in length without making approximations to attention. 3. we propose an enhancement to the blockwise parallel transformers (BPT) framework.

Our take on this is that prompting is not scalable if you want to pick between 1000s of APIs. So Gorilla is a LLM that can pick and write the semantically and syntactically correct API for you to call! A drop in replacement into LangChain!

### **Evaluation metrics** / Math

*   Automated evaluation of LLMs
*   n-gram based metrics: Evaluates the model using n-gram statistics and F1 score. ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR are used for summarization and translation tasks.
*   Probabilistic model evaluation metrics: Evaluates the model using the predictive performance of probability models. Perplexity.
*   Embedding based metrics: Evaluates the model using semantic similarity of embeddings. Ada Similarity and BERTScore are used.

    <details>
    <summary>Expand</summary>

    *   ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation): The metrics compare an automatically produced summary or translation against a reference or a set of references (human-produced) summary or translation. It includes several measures such as:

        1.  ROUGE-N: Overlap of n-grams between the system and reference summaries.
        2.  ROUGE-L: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) based statistics.
        3.  ROUGE-W: Weighted LCS-based statistics that favor consecutive LCSes.
        4.  ROUGE-S: Skip-bigram based co-occurrence statistics.
        5.  ROUGE-SU: Skip-bigram plus unigram-based co-occurrence statistics1.

    *   n-gram: An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. For example, in the sentence ‚ÄúI love AI‚Äù, the unigrams (1-gram) are ‚ÄúI‚Äù, ‚Äúlove‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI‚Äù; the bigrams (2-gram) are ‚ÄúI love‚Äù, ‚Äúlove AI‚Äù; and the trigram (3-gram) is ‚ÄúI love AI‚Äù.

    *   BLEU: BLEU‚Äôs output is always a number between 0 and 1. An algorithm for evaluating the quality of machine-translated text. The closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is.

    *   BERTScore: A metric that leverages pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT for text generation tasks. It combines precision and recall values.

    *   Perplexity: A measure of a model's predictive performance, with lower values indicating better prediction.

    *   METEOR: An n-gram based metric for machine translation, considering precision, recall, and semantic similarity.

    </details>
*   Human evaluation of LLMs (possibly Automate by LLM-based metrics): Evaluate the model‚Äôs performance on NLU and NLG tasks. It includes evaluations of relevance, fluency, coherence, and groundedness.
