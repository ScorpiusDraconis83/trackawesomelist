## [3. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Rules and Similarity in Concept Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1999/hash/86d7c8a08b4aaa1bc7c599473f5dddda-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'99***, 1999. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10968021160883668417)]. \[[Preprint](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/archive/Papers/nips99preprint.pdf)]. This paper argues that two apparently distinct modes of generalizing concepts - abstracting rules and computing similarity to exemplars - should both be seen as special cases of a more general Bayesian learning framework. Bayes explains the specific workings of these two modes - which rules are abstracted, how similarity is measured - as well as why generalization should appear rule- or similarity-based in different situations. This analysis also suggests why the rules/similarity distinction, even if not computationally fundamental, may still be useful at the algorithmic level as part of a principled approximation to fully Bayesian learning.

## [4. Awesome Angular](/content/PatrickJS/awesome-angular/README.md)
