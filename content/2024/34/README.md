    *   Beam Search \[1977] in Transformers is an inference algorithm that maintains the `beam_size` most probable sequences until the end token appears or maximum sequence length is reached. If `beam_size` (k) is 1, it's a `Greedy Search`. If k equals the total vocabularies, it's an `Exhaustive Search`. [ref](https://huggingface.co/blog/constrained-beam-search) \[Mar 2022]

    #### Classification of Attention

    *   [ref](https://arize.com/blog-course/attention-mechanisms-in-machine-learning/): Must-Read Starter Guide to Mastering Attention Mechanisms in Machine Learning \[12 Jun 2023]

    1.  Encoder-Decoder Attention:

        1.  Soft Attention: assigns continuous weights to input elements, allowing the model to attend to multiple elements simultaneously. Used in neural machine translation.
        2.  Hard Attention: selects a subset of input elements to focus on while ignoring the rest. Used in image captioning.
        3.  Global Attention: focuses on all elements of the input sequence when computing attention weights. Captures long-range dependencies and global context.
        4.  Local Attention: focuses on a smaller, localized region of the input sequence when computing attention weights. Reduces computational complexity. Used in time series analysis.

    2.  Extended Forms of Attention: Only one Decoder component (only Input Sequence, no Target Sequence)

        1.  Self Attention: attends to different parts of the input sequence itself, rather than another sequence or modality. Captures long-range dependencies and contextual information. Used in transformer models.
        2.  Multi-head Self-Attention: performs self-attention multiple times in parallel, allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.

        <!-- 1. Hierarchical Attention: attends to different levels of granularity in the input sequence, allowing the model to capture both local and global context. -->

    3.  Other Types of Attention:

        1.  Sparse Attention: reduces computation by focusing on a limited selection of similarity scores in a sequence, resulting in a sparse matrix. It includes implementations of ‚Äústrided‚Äù and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù attention. [ref](https://blog.research.google/2020/10/rethinking-attention-with-performers.html) \[23 Oct 2020]

        <!-- <img src="https://github.com/kimtth/awesome-azure-openai-llm/raw/main/files/rethinking-attention-with-performers.gif"/> -->

        1.  Cross-Attention: mixes two different embedding sequences, allowing the model to attend to information from both sequences. In a Transformer, when the information is passed from encoder to decoder that part is known as Cross Attention. [ref](https://vaclavkosar.com/ml/cross-attention-in-transformer-architecture) / [ref](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2023/self-attention-from-scratch.html) \[9 Feb 2023]

        2.  Sliding Window Attention (SWA): A technique used Longformer. It uses a fixed-size window of attention around each token, which allows the model to scale efficiently to long inputs. Each token attends to half the window size tokens on each side. [ref (‚≠ê9.4k)](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src#sliding-window-to-speed-up-inference-and-reduce-memory-pressure)
