### Science Logology / Democratization of Science

*   [Five keys to writing a reproducible lab protocol](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02428-3) - ***Nature***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13259206850261301938)]. This interviewing paper introduces five ways to increase the reproducibility of experimental protocols: (i) documenting protocols as the experiment goes; (ii) providing video illustrations in addition to written protocols; (iii) using electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) for managing experimental resources digitally; (iv) depositing and documenting reagents with understanding the rationale behind every step; and (v) exploiting online platforms to share tips, extensions, methods, and data among researchers.
*   [The Experimental Design Assistant](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003779) - ***PLoS Biology***, 2017. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12481490526120919925)]. \[[Nature Methods Correspondence](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4462)]. \[[EDA Website](https://eda.nc3rs.org.uk/)].

This paper describes a plug-and-play, continuous-flow chemical synthesis system that mitigates this challenge with an integrated combination of hardware, software, and analytics. The system software controls the user-selected reagents and unit operations (reactors and separators), processes reaction analytics (high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, vibrational spectroscopy), and conducts automated optimizations.
