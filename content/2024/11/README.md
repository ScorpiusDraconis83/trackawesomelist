*   Instead of a hard-coded prompt template, "Modular approach: compositions of modules -> compile". Building blocks such as ChainOfThought or Retrieve and compiling the program, optimizing the prompts based on specific metrics. Unifying strategies for both prompting and fine-tuning in one tool, Pythonic operations, prioritizing and tracing program execution. These features distinguish it from other LMP frameworks such as LangChain, and LlamaIndex. [ref](https://towardsai.net/p/machine-learning/inside-dspy-the-new-language-model-programming-framework-you-need-to-know-about) \[Jan 2023]
*   Automatically iterate until the best result is achieved: 1. Collect Data -> 2. Write DSPy Program -> 3. Define validtion logic -> 4. Compile DSPy program

    <img src="https://github.com/kimtth/awesome-azure-openai-llm/raw/main/.\files\dspy-workflow.jpg" width="400" alt="workflow">
*   DSPy vs. LangChain, LlamaIndex: LangChain and LlamaIndex offer pre-built modules for specific applications. DSPy provides general-purpose modules that learn to optimize your language model based on your data and pipeline. It's like the difference between PyTorch (DSPy) and HuggingFace Transformers (higher-level libraries).

### **DSPy** / **DSPy Glossary**

*   Glossary reference to the [ref](https:/towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-dspy-goodbye-prompting-hello-programming-4ca1c6ce3eb9).
    1.  Signatures: Hand-written prompts and fine-tuning are abstracted and replaced by signatures.
        > "question -> answer" <br/>
        > "long-document -> summary"  <br/>
        > "context, question -> answer"  <br/>
    2.  Modules: Prompting techniques, such as `Chain of Thought` or `ReAct`, are abstracted and replaced by modules.
        ```python
        # pass a signature to ChainOfThought module
        generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought("context, question -> answer")
        ```
    3.  Optimizers (formerly Teleprompters): Manual iterations of prompt engineering is automated with optimizers (teleprompters) and a DSPy Compiler.
        ```python
        # Self-generate complete demonstrations. Teacher-student paradigm, `BootstrapFewShotWithOptuna`, `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch` etc. which work on the same principle.
        optimizer = BootstrapFewShot(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match)
        ```
    4.  DSPy Compiler: Internally trace your program and then optimize it using an optimizer (teleprompter) to maximize a given metric (e.g., improve quality or cost) for your task.
    *   e.g., the DSPy compiler optimizes the initial prompt and thus eliminates the need for manual prompt tuning.
        ```python
        cot_compiled = teleprompter.compile(CoT(), trainset=trainset, valset=devset)
        cot_compiled.save('turbo_gsm8k.json')
        ```

### **Section 4** : Langchain Features, Usage, and Comparisons / DSPy optimizer

*   It highlights two main value props of the framework:

    1.  Components: modular abstractions and implementations for working with language models, with easy-to-use features.

    2.  Use-Case Specific Chains: chains of components that assemble in different ways to achieve specific use cases, with customizable interfaces.cite: [ref](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/)

    *   LangChain 0.2: full separation of langchain and langchain-community. [ref](https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-v02-leap-to-stability) \[May 2024]

        '''
        chain = prompt | model | parser
        ```

### **Prompt Engineering** / **Prompt Template Language**

*   [Automatic Prompt Engineer (APE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01910): Automatically optimizing prompts. APE has discovered zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts superior to human-designed prompts like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think through this step-by-step‚Äù (Kojima et al., 2022). The prompt ‚ÄúTo get the correct answer, let‚Äôs think step-by-step.‚Äù triggers a chain of thought. Two approaches to generate high-quality candidates: forward mode and reverse mode generation. \[3 Nov 2022] [git (‚≠ê1k)](https://github.com/keirp/automatic_prompt_engineer) / [ref](https:/towardsdatascience.com/automated-prompt-engineering-78678c6371b9) \[Mar 2024]

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Automated Biodesign Engineering by Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07758) - ***AAAI Spring Symposium Series 2021 on Artificial Intelligence for Synthetic Biology***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=543730388062329581\&as_sdt=0,5)]. This work proposes an automated biodesign engineering framework empowered by Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning (MetaAbd), a novel machine learning approach that combines symbolic and sub-symbolic machine learning, to further enhance the design-build-test-learn cycle by enabling the learning machine to 1) exploit domain knowledge and learn human-interpretable models that are expressed by formal languages such as first-order logic; 2) simultaneously optimise the structure and parameters of the models to make accurate numerical predictions; 3) reduce the cost of experiments and effort on data annotation by actively generating hypotheses and examples.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [PClean: Bayesian Data Cleaning at Scale with Domain-Specific Probabilistic Programming](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/lew21a.html) - ***ICML'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2892523061439714130)]. This work presents PClean, a probabilistic programming language (PPL) for leveraging dataset-specific knowledge to automate Bayesian cleaning, automating Bayesian approaches given the diversity of real-world error patterns and the hardness of inference.

### Meta-Level Considerations / Rationality

*   [Cognitive Science as a Source of Forward and Inverse Models of Human Decisions for Robotics and Control](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/ho2022cognitive.pdf) - ***Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs\&cluster=14055765901243029337)]. The review focuses on how cognitive science can provide forward models of human decision-making and inverse models of how humans think about others‚Äô decision-making. The authors highlight relevant recent developments, including approaches that synthesize black box and theory-driven modeling, accounts that recast heuristics and biases as forms of bounded optimality, and models that characterize human theory of mind and communication in decision-theoretic terms.

### Science Logology / Laboratory Automation

*   [A mobile robotic chemist](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2442-2) - ***Nature***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13216902493789027324\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. \[[Preprint](https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/74759/1/Burger_etal_Nature_2020_A_mobile_robotic.pdf)]. This work uses a mobile robot to search for improved photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water. The robot operated autonomously over eight days, performing 688 experiments within a ten-variable experimental space, driven by a batched Bayesian search algorithm. This autonomous search identified photocatalyst mixtures that were six times more active than the initial formulations, selecting beneficial components and deselecting negative ones.

A new algorithm that synthesizes functional reactive programs from observation data, which iterates between a functional synthesis step, which attempts to generate a transition function over observed states, and an automata synthesis step, which adds any additional latent state necessary to fully account for the observations.
