### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Automated Biodesign Engineering by Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07758) - ***AAAI Spring Symposium Series 2021 on Artificial Intelligence for Synthetic Biology***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=543730388062329581\&as_sdt=0,5)]. This work proposes an automated biodesign engineering framework empowered by Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning (MetaAbd), a novel machine learning approach that combines symbolic and sub-symbolic machine learning, to further enhance the design-build-test-learn cycle by enabling the learning machine to 1) exploit domain knowledge and learn human-interpretable models that are expressed by formal languages such as first-order logic; 2) simultaneously optimise the structure and parameters of the models to make accurate numerical predictions; 3) reduce the cost of experiments and effort on data annotation by actively generating hypotheses and examples.

### Domain Specific Language / Domain Specified Applications

*   [PClean: Bayesian Data Cleaning at Scale with Domain-Specific Probabilistic Programming](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/lew21a.html) - ***ICML'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2892523061439714130)]. This work presents PClean, a probabilistic programming language (PPL) for leveraging dataset-specific knowledge to automate Bayesian cleaning, automating Bayesian approaches given the diversity of real-world error patterns and the hardness of inference.

The review focuses on how cognitive science can provide forward models of human decision-making and inverse models of how humans think about others‚Äô decision-making.
