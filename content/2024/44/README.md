### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Theory-based Bayesian models of inductive learning and reasoning](https://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S1364-6613\(06\)00134-3) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2006. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6741344960992898446)]. \[[Preprint](http://www.charleskemp.com/papers/TenenbaumGK06.pdf)]. Inductive inference allows humans to make powerful generalizations from sparse data when learning about word meanings, unobserved properties, causal relationships, and many other aspects of the world. Traditional accounts of induction emphasize either the power of statistical learning, or the importance of strong constraints from structured domain knowledge, intuitive theories or schemas. This paper argues that both components are necessary to explain the nature, use and acquisition of human knowledge, and the authors introduce a theory-based Bayesian framework for modeling inductive learning and reasoning as statistical inferences over structured knowledge representations.
