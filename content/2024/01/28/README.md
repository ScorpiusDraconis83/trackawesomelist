## [2. Awesome Azure Openai Llm](/content/kimtth/awesome-azure-openai-llm/README.md)

### **Caching** / **OSS Alternatives for OpenAI Code Interpreter (aka. Advanced Data Analytics)**

*   Caching: A technique to store data that has been previously retrieved or computed, so that future requests for the same data can be served faster.
*   To reduce latency, cost, and LLM requests by serving pre-computed or previously served responses.
*   Strategies for caching: Caching can be based on item IDs, pairs of item IDs, constrained input, or pre-computation. Caching can also leverage embedding-based retrieval, approximate nearest neighbor search, and LLM-based evaluation.

### **Defensive UX** / **OSS Alternatives for OpenAI Code Interpreter (aka. Advanced Data Analytics)**

*   Defensive UX: A design strategy that aims to prevent and handle errors in user interactions with machine learning or LLM-based products.
*   Why defensive UX?: Machine learning and LLMs can produce inaccurate or inconsistent output, which can affect user trust and satisfaction. Defensive UX can help by increasing accessibility, trust, and UX quality.
*   [Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/guidelines-for-human-ai-interaction/): Microsoft: Based on a survey of 168 potential guidelines from various sources, they narrowed it down to 18 action rules organized by user interaction stages.
*   [People + AI Guidebook](https://pair.withgoogle.com/guidebook/): Google: Google‚Äôs product teams and academic research, they provide 23 patterns grouped by common questions during the product development process3.
*   [Human Interface Guidelines for Machine Learning](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/machine-learning): Apple: Based on practitioner knowledge and experience, emphasizing aspects of UI rather than model functionality4.
