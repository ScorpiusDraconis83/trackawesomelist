### **Prompt Engineering** / **Prompt Template Language**

*   [Self-Consistency (CoT-SC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171): The three steps in the self-consistency method: 1) prompt the language model using CoT prompting, 2) sample a diverse set of reasoning paths from the language model, and 3) marginalize out reasoning paths to aggregate final answers and choose the most consistent answer. \[21 Mar 2022]
*   [Tree of Thought (ToT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601): \[[cnt](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en\&as_sdt=0%2C5\&q=arxiv%3A+2305.10601)]: Self-evaluate the progress intermediate thoughts make towards solving a problem \[17 May 2023] [git (‚≠ê4.6k)](https://github.com/ysymyth/tree-of-thought-llm) / Agora: Tree of Thoughts (ToT) [git (‚≠ê4.3k)](https://github.com/kyegomez/tree-of-thoughts)

*   [Re-Reading Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06275): RE2 (Re-Reading), which involves re-reading the question as input to enhance the LLM's understanding of the problem. `Read the question again` \[12 Sep 2023]

### **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) & SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)** / **Llama Finetuning**

*   Preference optimization techniques: [ref](https://x.com/helloiamleonie/status/1823305448650383741) \[13 Aug 2024]
    *   `DPO (Direct preference optimization)`  removes the need for a reward model.
    *   `IPO (Identity Preference Optimization)` : A change in the objective, which is simpler and less prone to overfitting.
    *   `KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization)` : Scales more data by replacing the pairs of accepted and rejected generations with a binary label.
    *   `ORPO (Odds Ratio Preference Optimization)` : Combines instruction tuning and preference optimization into one training process, which is cheaper and faster.
