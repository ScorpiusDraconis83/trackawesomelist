Your contributions are highly welcome (first see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake/blob/master/README.md/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

There is another file [`NonModernCMake.md`](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake/blob/master/README.md/NonModernCMake.md) with other links worth taking a look, but they use obsolete practices which are considered non-modern - like not using `target_*`-based dependency management - see [`#16`](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake/issues/16) and [`#42`](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake/pull/42) for more details.
