> This is an evolution of the Westwar series first introduced by Vanguard Games with Pas de Calais. Other games using a similar system are To the Far Shore and the Italian Campaign series (Sicily, Salerno, Anzio and Med War).
>
> Tide of Fortune features the September-October Allied campaign in northern Belgium and in the Low countries, culminating with the Arnhem operation.
>
> Scale is 1-2 days/turn (variable because of the Impulse system), 3 km/hex. Units are regiments/brigades.
>
> The game has 2 22"x34" maps, 300 counters.
>
> The heart of the system is the Operations phase where players alternate activating formations (divisions) which execute Orders (Assault, Advance, Maneuver etc.).
>
> Players bid for Initiative and there are possibilities for the Reaction player to foil the initiative player's moves by having units react and do spoiling attacks.
>
> Losses can be applied to the HQ of a formation, not only directly to units.
>
> Low counter density, high maneuver. Medium-high complexity.

### [Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126163/tzolk-mayan-calendar)

> Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker placement. Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots.
> During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker. Actions located "later" on the gears are more valuable, so it's wise to let the time work for you ‚Äì but players cannot skip their turn; if they have all their workers on the gears, they have to pick some up.

### [Paladins of the West Kingdom](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266810/paladins-west-kingdom)

> Paladins of the West Kingdom is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.
> The aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.

### [Concordia Venus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/256916/concordia-venus)

> Concordia Venus is a standalone reimplementation of Concordia with some added features.
> Concordia Venus is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-6 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:
> They allow a player to choose actions during the game.
> They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.

> Welcome to Arle
> In Fields of Arle, created by Uwe Rosenberg, one to two players live as farmers in the small and peaceful town of Arle in East Frisia. The flax grown in the land surrounding the village makes it a profitable place to work and live. Fields of Arle takes players through four and a half years of this era of prosperity, with different opportunities available as the seasons change. Farm the land to capitalize on the demand for flax, or find other ways to make the most of the small town‚Äôs prosperity.
> Work the Land
> Whether you delve into flax farming or leverage other areas of expertise, always make sure that you have the land to build up your village. Construct dikes to keep the waters at bay and expand your fields. Dry out bogs to harvest peat and then clear the land for cultivation. Create more fields for your livestock, buildings, or future crops; after that, you can decide whether to house animals or cultivate a forest for timber. Perhaps you‚Äôd like to take up some flax farming for yourself, or diversify and try out a little bit of everything.

> In Le Havre, a player's turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action. As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.
> After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.

It is played by four players according to the original rules, but can be adapted to be played by just two (the three-player game would be unbalanced).The 6x6 board is surrounded by Mancala-like pits, where pebbles are moved. The number of pebbles in a row/column/diagonal's pits controls how the pawns on the board move.Two sets of rules are supplied: the Alignment game, where you are trying to be the first to align four of your pawns in any six-space row --either horizontally, vertically or diagonally-- without opposing pawns between them, and the more advanced Capture game, where you're trying to capture your opponents' key pawns (kings, really).

### [Bruxelles 1893](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/144592/bruxelles-1893)

> Bruxelles 1893 is a worker placement game with elements of bidding and majority control. Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yields the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money ‚Äì acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige ‚Äì while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they've placed their workers next to on the action board.After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they've completed their work, and their money on hand. The player with the most points wins.

> Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccol√≤ Machiavelli published his masterpiece "The Prince," backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.Here I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics, and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3‚Äì4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.

The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimio to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.With accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups.

Variability is ensured not only by multiple playable houses with their own strengths and weaknesses, but also by many different map set-ups for all game modes.

### [Septima](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/360692/septima)

> Septima is a competitive, highly interactive strategy game of witchcraft. As the leader of your coven, you must prove your worth in the town of Noctenburg to become the successor of Septima, the High Witch. Practice your craft and gain Wisdom by collecting herbs, brewing potions, healing the townsfolk, mastering charms and rescuing your fellow brothers and sisters from the trials.
> Simultaneous action selection with positive player interaction: Septima‚Äôs central mechanism revolves around the simultaneous, secret selection of one of nine Action cards each turn: Move, Collect, Brew, Heal, Recruit, Plea, Chant, Rite and Remember. Each Action gets a powerful bonus if it is chosen by multiple players, but performing them together also raises suspicion in the townsfolk and attracts the attention of the Witch Hunters. Decisions of when to do a shared action (and who to do it with) adds a fresh, semi-cooperative touch to a competitive game, and lots of player interaction.
> Rescue witches to build your Coven: Heal, enthrall or convince the townsfolk and amass enough support to sway the periodic Witch Trials in your favor. If the hostile witnesses are outvoted, the convicted witch is absolved and joins the coven that rescued them. You start small but you can grow your coven to up to four witches this way, each with their own personality and special ability to help your cause. Reckless Witches caught by Witch Hunters are also put to trial, so with enough support from the townsfolk, even witches from other, less careful players‚Äô coven can end up in yours.
> Accessible, intuitive and familiar: Septima is Mindclash Games‚Äô most accessible title to date, with beautiful, hand-drawn art style by Vill≈ë Farkas and with the character art of Barbara Bern√°t, wooden components and intuitive, theme-inspired mechanisms. It is very quick to teach and set up, and takes less than 2 hours to play, even with four players.

### [Evacuation](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/382843/evacuation)

> In Evacuation, life on our planet is being burned away thanks to increasingly intense sunlight, so everyone is trying to move all the people and factories in their territories from the "old" planet to a new one ‚Äî and they have only four rounds in which to do so.You start the game with a full functioning economy, and over the course of play, you must dismantle that economy and move it. Income on the old planet shrinks over time, and production probably won't be much better until you establish yourself on the new planet and kick things into action. Resources can't be mixed across the planets, so you need to take special care with your planning.To do this, you choose actions from the player board, with the expert variant adding cards to your hand that allow you to choose additional actions and combine them. Each action has its own value, and the sum of these actions is important for an "end of the round" bonus. Additionally, players move their markers along the orbital track based on the value of their actions.If you can raise production of three resources to level 8 and have three virtual reality machines on the new planet, you win.

### [Sky Team](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/373106/sky-team)

> Sky Team is a co-operative game, exclusively for two players, in which you play a pilot and co-pilot at the controls of an airliner. Your goal is to work together as a team to land your airplane in different airports around the world.To land your plane, you need to silently assign your dice to the correct spaces in your cockpit to balance the axis of your plane, control its speed, deploy the flaps, extend the landing gear, contact the control tower to clear your path, and even have a little coffee to improve your concentration enough to change the value of your dice.If the aircraft tilts too much and stalls, overshoots the airport, or collides with another aircraft, you lose the game...and your pilot's license...and probably your life.From Montreal to Tokyo, each airport offers its own set of challenges. Watch out for the turbulence as this could end up being bumpy ride!

### [Living Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Forest_\(board_game\))

> Living Forest is a 2021 board game designed by Aske Christiansen.Players act as Spirits of Nature to defend trees from being burnt by Onibi. Each turn is split into three phases, the guardian animal phase, the action phase, and attacks by Onibi. In the guardian phase, players draw guardian animal cards to form help lines using a push-your-luck mechanism.The action phase is split into actions that players may perform depending on the symbols on their help line, including gaining fragment tiles, attracting guardian animals, extinguishing a fire, moving on the Circle of Spirits board, or placing a protective tree. However, the strengths of the actions vary depending on symbols on guardian animal cards. For example, players may only extinguish fires for which they have fire symbols. After the action phase, the players have to take penalty cards to their own discard pile, a tree is attacked, and guardian animals are altered. Once a player reaches one of the game thresholds, including planting 12 trees, extinguishing 12 fires or gaining 12 flower symbols, the player ending the game wins.

### [Pallanguzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallanguzhi)

> Pallanguzhi or Pallankuli (fourteen pits) is a traditional mancala game played in south India. The game later also spread to as far as Sri Lanka and Malaysia. The game is played by two players, with a wooden board that has fourteen pits in all. There have been several variations in the layout of the pits, one among them being seven pits on each player's side. The pits contain cowry shells, seeds or small pebbles used as counters. It is played on a rectangular board with two rows and seven columns. 12 counters are placed in each cup except the middle of each row into which only 2 counters are placed. The starting player lifts the counters from any of his holes and, going counter-clockwise, distributes one counter in each hole. If he reaches the end of his cups he goes on his opponent's side of the board. When the player drops his last counter, he takes the counter from the next cup and continues placing them in this way. If the last counter falls into a cup with an empty cup beyond, the counters in the cup beyond the empty hole are captured by the player and put into his store. That player then continues play from the next cup containing counters. If the last counter falls into a cup with two empty holes beyond, he captures no counters and his turn is over. The next player continues play in the same way, taking counters from any of his cups and going around placing counters in a counter-clockwise direction. If, after having acounter dropped into it, a counter contains 6 counters, those become the property of the player who dropped it. The round is over when no counters remain.

### [Forest Shuffle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/391163/forest-shuffle)

> In Forest Shuffle, players compete to gather the most valuable trees, then attract species to these trees, thus creating an ecologically balanced habitat for flora and fauna.To start, each player has six cards in hand, with cards depicting either a particular type of tree or two forest dwellers (animal, plant, mushroom, etc.), with these latter cards being divided in half, whether vertically or horizontally, with one dweller in each card half.On a turn, either draw two cards ‚Äî whether face down from the deck or face up from the clearing ‚Äî and add them to your hand, or play a card from your hand by paying the cost, then putting it into play.Each tree and dweller shows a cost, and to pay this cost, you must discard cards from your hand into the clearing face up. If you play a tree, flip the top card of the deck into the clearing, then place the tree in front of you. If you play a dweller, pay only the cost on the dweller you choose, then slide this card under a tree that has an empty side that matches the dweller you want to play. (A tree can have cards played on all four sides of it: top, bottom, left, and right.)
