*   The Problem with RAG
    1.  A question is not semantically similar to its answers. Cosine similarity may favor semantically similar texts that do not contain the answer.
    2.  Semantic similarity gets diluted if the document is too long. Cosine similarity may favor short documents with only the relevant information.

## [6. Awesome Board Games](/content/edm00se/awesome-board-games/README.md)

### Strategy

### [Ambush!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1608/ambush)

> Ambush! is a strategy board game developed by Avalon Hill, known for its innovative approach to single-player gameplay in the wargaming genre. Released in 1983, it broke away from the traditional requirement of two players by allowing a solo player to engage in man-to-man combat scenarios. What made Ambush! unique was its use of tables, charts, and a "paragraph book" to control the opponent's actions, eliminating the need for an opposing player. This approach kept the enemy hidden until they became visible through gameplay, enhancing the element of surprise and realism. While it allowed for multiple players to participate by controlling different squads or soldiers, the complexity of scenario creation often required players to purchase expansion modules. Ambush! is a strategy game that offers an engaging and challenging experience for players seeking tactical warfare simulations.
