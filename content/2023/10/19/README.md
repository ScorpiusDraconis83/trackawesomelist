### [Tide of Fortune](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3354/tide-fortune)

> This is an evolution of the Westwar series first introduced by Vanguard Games with Pas de Calais. Other games using a similar system are To the Far Shore and the Italian Campaign series (Sicily, Salerno, Anzio and Med War).
>
> Tide of Fortune features the September-October Allied campaign in northern Belgium and in the Low countries, culminating with the Arnhem operation.
>
> Scale is 1-2 days/turn (variable because of the Impulse system), 3 km/hex. Units are regiments/brigades.
>
> The game has 2 22"x34" maps, 300 counters.
>
> The heart of the system is the Operations phase where players alternate activating formations (divisions) which execute Orders (Assault, Advance, Maneuver etc.).
>
> Players bid for Initiative and there are possibilities for the Reaction player to foil the initiative player's moves by having units react and do spoiling attacks.
>
> Losses can be applied to the HQ of a formation, not only directly to units.
>
> Low counter density, high maneuver. Medium-high complexity.

### [Frosthaven](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295770/frosthaven)

> Frosthaven is a standalone adventure from the designer and publisher of Gloomhaven that features sixteen new characters, three new races, more than twenty new enemies, more than one hundred new items, and a new, 100-scenario campaign. Characters and items from Gloomhaven will be usable in Frosthaven, and vice versa.In addition to having the well-known combat mechanisms of Gloomhaven, Frosthaven will feature much more to do outside of combat, such as numerous mysteries to solve, a seasonal event system to live through, and player control over how this ramshackle village expands, with each new building offering new ways to progress.Frosthaven has a whole new set of items but there is a mechanic for bringing items over from 'Gloomhaven'. However, as it is a remote location, these products get imported and are not there as standard. Resources are much more valuable and you have to build items through a crafting system rather than just buy them.
